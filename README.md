# dccompetition_collaboration

My first try on solving a DataCamp competition challenge. 

This competition is called **Employee Network Analysis** and consists of the following 4 questions which are expected to be covered in form of a report:
  1. Which departments are the most/least active?
  2. Which employee has the most connections? 
  3. Identify the most influential departments and employees.
  4. Using the network analysis, in which departments would you recommend the HR team focus to boost collaboration?

Two Datasets are provided that are used to answer these: **employees.csv** and **messages.csv**.
Messages has information on the sender, receiver, and time. Employees has information on each employee.
